# READMEs

Every project should have a dedicated README that documents important information. Ideally, READMEs should provide an engineer with everything they need to get started with the project and begin contributing. Since READMEs are living documents, it's important to update them as information changes or it becomes clear the README is missing something.

We provide a [README template](https://github.com/Andrews-McMeel-Universal/amu-code_standards/tree/production/general/github/readmes/README_TEMPLATE.md) to help get started, which can either be copied to a new repo (don't forget to change the name) or used to supplement updates to an existing README.
