# Alfred Productivity App

## Purpose

Alfred is a macOS-specific application installed by homebrew. The purpose of the
app is to offer a _spotlight_-like task launcher which can quickly launch and
find applications, files, images, and more. It also has powerful features for
speeding up your productivity. The settings brought over into your root
directory are responsible for the following:

1. Updates the global shortcut to CMD+Spacebar (overriding the default macOS
   spotlight shortcut)
2. Increases the size of the alfred search window and switches it into dark-mode.
3. Sets up integration with 1password so passwords don't require opening the
   1password app.
4. Enables the global clipboard and snippets feature so they can be opened using
   CMD+c and CMD+v, respectively.
5. Enables a number of other file types and search types so Alfred can retrieve
   virtually anything from it's searchbar.
6. Enables snippets and adds one example for pasting in our pull request
   template when a repo does not currently have it.
7. Turns on "EJECTALL" keyword for ejecting all mountable disks. This is useful
   for external harddrives and other mounted volumes.
