# React Dotfiles

# ES6 Coding Standards

We follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style
Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), which is sensible and widely
adopted, and includes ready-made configs for our linter of choice,
[ESLint](https://github.com/Andrews-McMeel-Universal/amu-code_standards/tree/production/javascript/es6/linters).

This is a collection of files related to the best current implementations we
have for React/Next.js stack.

_NOTE: This section is very much still "under construction" so please be patient
as we work through this together._
