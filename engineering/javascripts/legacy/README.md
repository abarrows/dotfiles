# ES6 Coding Standards

We follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style
Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), which is sensible and widely
adopted, and includes ready-made configs for our linter of choice,
[ESLint](https://github.com/Andrews-McMeel-Universal/amu-code_standards/tree/production/javascript/es6/linters).
